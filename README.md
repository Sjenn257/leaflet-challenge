# Leaflet Challenge - Earthquakes

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

For this assignment, I worked on a visualization showing earthquake data for the last 30 days. I used their API to access the data and developed a Leaflet map that plots all of the earthquakes in the last 30 days based on their longitude and latitude. The markers increase with magnitude and colors deepen with the depth of the earthquake.
